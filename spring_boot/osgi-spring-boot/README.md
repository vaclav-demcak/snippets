# SpringBoot / OSGi framework
This project is showing a simple way to use a SpringBoot application server and extending it with OSGi bundle.
The application is including a service which is loading and exposing the Felix OSGi Framework. With a proper configuration you will be able to use it for "plugins".

The target it is to have a lit of bundles implementing an interface exposed by the core. The main application will use this class to invoke bundles code.

## Software Architecture
Inside the project there are several modules:
* *commons* is a module shared with bundles and containing Interface for shared service class.
* *core* is the main project containing controllers for API, the OSGi framework, ...
* *sample-bundle* is a test bundle. By default it is deployed during the build inside the *auto-deploy* folder.

To autodeploy bundles, the project is using the [felix fileinstall bundle](https://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-file-install.html). The maven build is adding the bundle library to the correct OSGi framework lib folder.
```xml
<outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/internal-bundles</outputDirectory>
```

## Build the project
With a simple
```bash
mvn clean install
```
all the files will be placed in the correct folders.

## Start the application
Once build you can start the SpringBoot application within you terminal console (or any IDE will work the same)
```bash
java -jar core/target/core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application will even load the sample bundle within the `plugins` folder.
You can play with it simply removing, adding back, ... and check what the OSGi server will be

## Docker
The application is coming with a sample Dockerfile which shows how an OSGi / SpringBoot application can be packaged, following the Docker best practices.
To build the docker image you can use the following command from the project root folder:
```bash 
docker build -t osgi-sample -f core/src/docker/Dockerfile core
```

To start the container once build you can use a command like the following (you need to adapt it based on your environment):
```bash
docker run -it -e pluginsService.org.osgi.framework.storage=/app/felix-cache -e pluginsService.felix.auto.deploy.dir=/app/internal-bundles  -e pluginsService.felix.fileinstall.dir=/app/plugins -v /Users/Marco/Projects/springboot-osgi-sample/plugins:/app/plugins -p 8080:8080 osgi-sample
```
The plugins/bundle are managed in a docker external volume. This means you can easily add them without rebuilding your base image. Only the `internal-bundles` folder is inside the docker itself. This because this JARs are considered mandatory for this sample project.

As we are using a multi layer best practices splitting libraries from project source file. If we do not change the dependencies, only the last layer of the Dockerfile will be updated when we modified the source code. This will also allow a quick deployment of your images.

## Test the application
The application is exposing simples APIs:

`GET /v1/samples` to retrieve the list of installed bundles.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/samples
[
  "sample-bundle-src",
  "sample-bundle"
]
```

`GET /v1/samples/<bundle-name>` to execute the Action method inside the deployed bundle with the `bandle-name`.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/samples/sample-bundle
{
"body": "Action Worked !!"
}

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/samples/sample-bundle2
{
"body": "Plugin not found for sample-bundle2"
}
```

`GET /v1/samples/sample-bundle/notification` to execute the Notification method inside the deployed bundle with the `bandle-name`.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/samples/sample-bundle/notification
{
"body": "Notification Processed..."
}
```

## Plugin Samples
Inside the project there are two different bundle samples. A first one using the `BundleActivator` and the `maven-bundle-plugin` to package it; a second one which is using the SCR service registration (instead of the Activator) and with the `bnd-maven-plugin`.
Both two are working and bringing to the same expected result.

### BundleActivator
The Bundle with the Activator is using directly the OSGi Ativator workflow: inside a bundle there is a Activator class which is managing the `start` and `stop` operation. In this project, as for each bundle the operation is always the same (register a service to the `BundleContext`), instead of directly implementing the `BundleActivator` interface, there is an `AbstractPluginActivator` which is able to take care to these operations for the bundles.

### SCR
The Service Component Runtime is using a different approach: if you want only to register services implementing an interface, you can use annotations to allow the core application to identify which service should be registered.
This is managed by the Apache Felix SCR bundle.
Inside your bundle, to define a `IPlugin service you just need to create your class in the following way
```java
@Component(service = IPlugin.class)
@Slf4j
public class MyBundle implements IPlugin {
  
}
```
The `@Component` annotation is the one doing the tricks here.
